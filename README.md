# AKnorm

This repository contains code for Aaron and Karsten's work on single-cell normalization. 
If you're not 25 years old and named Aaron Lun or Karsten Bach, you're probably at the wrong place.
I suppose an exception could be made for older people, especially those with names like John Marioni.
